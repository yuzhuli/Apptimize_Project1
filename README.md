# Apptimize_Project1

According to Selenium documentation, we need to setup our test for running with ChromeDriver.

I have already included the ChromeDriver binary I used in this repository. 

But in case it doesn't work on your computer, please follow the steps below to solve the issue.

1. Delete the original chromedriver you got from this repository

1. Go to https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads

2. Download the ChromeDriver binary to the same directory as Yuzhu_Project1.py

3. Unzip it. 

4. Yuzhu_Project1.py should work now.
